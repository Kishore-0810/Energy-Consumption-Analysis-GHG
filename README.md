# Energy-Consumption-Analysis-GHG in PowerBI
Project will analyze energy usage and greenhouse gas emissions of Ontario's Broader Public Sector (BPS) organizations, leveraging a database of reported data. We aim to identify trends, assess conservation effectiveness, and pinpoint areas for improvement, informing data-driven strategies to achieve climate change mitigation goals within the BPS.

The Dataset spans from 2012 to 2020 and contains information about BPS organizations, including public hospitals and school boards.Key attributes include organization details, operational information, energy consumption data, and GHG emissions.

## Data Preparation and Cleansing:
Clean and transform the data into a format suitable for analysis by handling missing values, and deriving relevant features.

## Exploratory Data Analysis-PowerBI:
Employ statistical analysis and visualization techniques to uncover key trends, patterns, and relationships within the data.
Develop compelling and interactive visualizations using Tableau or Power-BI to effectively communicate key insights from the EDA.
Create dashboards showcasing energy consumption and GHG emissions by sector, organization, and facility type.

## Tools Used:
* Python
* Pandas
* PowerBI Desktop
